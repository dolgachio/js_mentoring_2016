To run application
1. npm install
2. npm start - launch emulation on default android device

In my application I use 3 plugins to add notifications:
1. cordova-plugin-calendar - for adding calendar events with notifications
2. de.appplant.cordova.plugin.local-notification  - for adding local notifications
3. mentoring-MyCalendar - custom plugin for adding calendar events with notifications

Everything were tested on Android 4.3.2 and Google Nexus 5

To build application:
npm run release
